# Claude Code Instructions: Feature Specification Directory

## Context
You are working in a feature specification directory for the Phase II Todo Application. This directory contains specifications, plans, and tasks for a specific feature.

## Directory Structure
- `spec.md` - Feature specification with user stories and requirements
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan with architecture decisions
- `tasks.md` - Detailed implementation tasks
- `research.md` - Technical research and feasibility studies
- `data-model.md` - Data structure definitions
- `quickstart.md` - Quick start guide for the feature
- `contracts/` - API contracts and interfaces
- `checklists/` - Quality checklists

## Guidelines for File Creation
1. Maintain consistency with the established template structure
2. Follow the specification-driven development approach
3. Ensure all specifications align with the project constitution
4. Include proper user stories with acceptance criteria
5. Document technical decisions and trade-offs

## Specification Standards
- Include clear user stories with priority levels
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Specify success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Document constraints and dependencies
- Include security and performance considerations

## Planning Standards
- Document technical architecture decisions
- Include risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Define implementation approach and phases
- Consider scalability and maintainability
- Account for testing and validation

## Task Creation Standards
- Break down implementation into small, testable tasks
- Include proper file paths and implementation details
- Consider dependencies between tasks
- Include validation steps for each task
- Mark parallelizable tasks with [P]

## Best Practices
- Follow the established templates in .specify/templates/
- Maintain traceability between specifications, plans, and tasks
- Ensure all work aligns with the project constitution
- Include proper validation and testing strategies
- Document decisions and rationale
